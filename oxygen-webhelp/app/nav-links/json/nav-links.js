It offers a fixed total         of points which you use to \"purchase\" your ability scores. Point buy is safer than rolling         but limits your chances of having very high ability scores early in the game. Point buy also         offers a quicker and easier way to make a character.<\/p>","href":"task2.html","attributes":{"data-id":"task_e1q_hxp_dpb"},"menu":{"hasChildren":true},"tocID":"task_e1q_hxp_dpb-d186e46","next":"task_e1q_hxp_dpb-d186e46"},{"title":"Races in Dungeons and Dragons","shortdesc":"<p class=\"shortdesc\">Races are one of the central aspects of your character, and they also change the         mechanics of your character, including abiltiy scores.
